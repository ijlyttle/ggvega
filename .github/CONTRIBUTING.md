# Contributing to ggvega

At the moment, this guide is intended for the vegawidget organization, so that we may collaborate more efficiently and reliably. When this package reaches a certain point, we will welcome contributions from the community.

- We will use the `master` branch as the reference branch.

- The `master` branch will be updated only by pull-request (PR).

- Each update of the `master` branch will have a new version number; this will be one of the things we check before merging a PR.

- We will not merge a PR into `master` unless the checks pass; this will help us make sure that the `master` branch always remains "passing".

- A PR into master will be reviewed by at least one author; exceptions can be made for merging PRs that fix bugs.

When we develop a new feature, we will establish a feature branch, e.g. `geom-rect`:

- we will each push our development work into that branch; I imagine each of us will be contributing R code, JS code, tests, and/or documentation.

- when we are all happy that the feature is "done", we will merge the PR for the feature branch, then delete the feature branch.
