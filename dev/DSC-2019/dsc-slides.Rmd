### ggvega

Created to translate from ggplot2 to Vega-Lite  

- inspired by the capability `plotly::ggplotly()` provides 

.center[
<br/><br/><br/>
**(add visual of ggplot2 -> vl)**
]

.footnote[
This project has been supported by Iowa State University, Schneider Electric, and GSOC.

# Motivation

---
### Goals

**ggplot2 + interactivity**

**build & deploy visual components** (in JS and HTML) 

- extensible to new data  

  - a guiding principle when making fundamental design choices

  - distinguishes this effort from `plotly::ggplotly()`

.center[
<br/><br/><br/>
**(example with update-able data??)**
]

### ggplot2 + interactivity

Our requirements for the JavaScript library:

  - has the grammar of graphics at its foundation  
  
  - is easy to use  
  
  - is able to be linked with other preexisting htmlwidgets  
  
  - can be tied to ggplot2

### Vega + Vega-Lite


Designed to be a visualization grammar that is built for analysis

Both Vega and Vega-lite use a JSON specification to create a visualization, with Vega-lite first compiling to
Vega and then rendered using Vegaâ€™s compiler.

An implementation of visualization terms with the
**grammar of graphics** at its core

Four basic factors that determine how good your food will taste: 

  - **salt**, which enhances flavor  
  - **fat**, which amplifies flavor and makes appealing textures possible
  - **acid**, which brightens and balances
  - **heat**, which ultimately determines the texture of food

The Vega-Lite specification can be deployed to production, independently of the data used to design it. Vega provides the means to update Vega views with new data.

# Examples

---
### ggvega



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("ggvega")
plot <- ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species))

as_vegaspec(plot)
```

???
vegawidget, an htmlwidget within the vegawidget GitHub organization, is used to render the specification created by ggvega. 

---
### ggvega + vlbuildr


```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("ggvega")
library("vlbuildr")

plot <- ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species))

as_vegaspec(plot) %>%
vl_encode_fill("Species:N")
```

???
Once the Vega-Lite specification has been created, we can use vlbuildr, another package within the vegawidget GitHub organization, to modify the specification. vlbuildr is "a functional approach to building up specifications" and the package contains functions that can add various components to a specification.

---
### Add selections with vlbuildr!


???

With vlbuildr, we can add selections and conditional encodings without addressing this issue in ggvega/ggplot2.
